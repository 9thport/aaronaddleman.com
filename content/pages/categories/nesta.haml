  Why use Nesta?
  Do you prefer writing and testing HTML and CSS in a text editor, rather than a browser window? Are you happy writing copy in Markdown or Textile? If so, Nesta might be for you. There's no database to configure â€“ everything is stored in text files. You can review your changes on a local copy of your web site, and copy the files to your server when you're ready to publish (most people use Git).
