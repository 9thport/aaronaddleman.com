%h1 About

Self taught computers at a young age, I enjoy solving problems by creating a solution(s) for the team to utilize to its fullest potential. The motto "plan to re-plan" is a constant reminder to me that things will not stay the same. My history of working with computers starts with MSDOS 3.11 and in the later years I found Linux and never really looked back to Windows (except only on curiosity). My other motto is "the best tool is the one that fits" which reminds me to keep learning new tools in order to provide better solutions.
